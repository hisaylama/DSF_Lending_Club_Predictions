# DSF Lending Club Predictions

This repository contains the development of predictive models for the Lending Club platform. The primary aim is to determine whether loan applications should be approved or rejected based on various financial indicators. 

- Dataset source - [Lending club dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faressayah/lending-club-loan-defaulters-prediction#%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F-Artificial-Neural-Networks-(ANNs))
- Report to use the repository - [Technical report](https://github.com/hisaylama/DSF_Lending_Club_Predictions/blob/main/Technical_Report.ipynb)

## Repository Contents

- `Data_cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for initial data cleaning processes.
- `Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Detailed exploratory data analysis of the lending dataset.
- `Predictive_model.ipynb`: Construction and validation of the predictive model.
- `Model_deployment.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the deployment of the predictive model.
- `Technical_Report.ipynb`: Comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, analyses, results, and conclusions of the predictive modeling process.
- `baseline_model_2.pkl`: Serialized version of one of the baseline models used for initial predictions.
- `ds6utility.py`: `Python` function file is used while running `Predictive_model.ipynb` .

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to enhance decision-making for loan approvals using data-driven insights. By applying machine learning models, we aim to:
- Deploy a real-time scoring model that can provide instant financial decisions - "Approve or nont approve loan"
- Implications
    - Minimize the risk of default by accurately predicting it based on the applicant's financial profile.
    - Reduce operational costs by automating the decision-making process, allowing for rapid loan application assessments.

## Real-time Scoring Application
The project explores the potential for a real-time scoring application that rates loan applicants as either 0 or 1. This score is determined by predictive models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, which classify applicants based on the likelihood of fulfilling loan repayment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run `.ipynb` files.
3. Follow the `Technical_Report.ipynb`


## Usage

Each notebook is self-contained and includes comments explaining the purpose of each section of code. Follow the notebooks in the order they are listed to replicate the analysis and model development.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with any enhancements, bug fixes, or improvements.
